# Symbolic Expressions
## Overview
Symbolic expressions shall provide the user with tools to represent symbolic mathematical expressions with a simple interface, as well as providing operator overloads to make working with symbolic expressions as similar as possible to normal arithmetic

* The module shall provide all the basic elementary functions such as
  * Basic arithmetic functions (Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division)
  * Exponentials, logarithms and trigonometric functions
* Symbolic Expressions shall support constants, variables, unary functions, binary functions, polynomials, products etc
* The module shall allow for setting up equalities and inequalities and allow for solving of these
